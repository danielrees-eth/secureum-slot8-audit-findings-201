## HoldeFi Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/holdefi-audit)

### 177. HoldeFi

**Finding**: Insufficient incentives to liquidator

**Description**: The liquidation process is a very important part of every DeFi project because it allows to extinguish the problem of having the whole system under-collateralized under critical conditions of the market, and it needs a design that incentivizes its speed of execution. The `Holdefi` contract implements the liquidation process for those accounts that may have an under-collateralized balance or that may have been inactive for a whole year without interacting with the project. The liquidator would end up paying for the expensive liquidation process, without receiving any benefit. Buying discounted collateral assets could be considered as an incentive to the liquidators

**Recommendation**: Consider improving the incentive design to give the liquidators higher incentives to execute the liquidation process

### 178. HoldeFi

**Finding**: Markets can become insolvent

**Description**: When the value of all collateral is worth less than the value of all borrowed assets, we say a market is insolvent. The `Holdefi` codebase can do many things to reduce the risk of market insolvency, including: prudent selection of collateral-ratios, incentivizing third-party collateral liquidation, careful selection of which tokens are listed on the platform, etc. However, the risk of insolvency cannot be entirely eliminated, and there are numerous ways a market can become insolvent.

**Recommendation**: This risk is not unique to the Holdefi project. All collateralized loans (even non-blockchain loans) have a risk of insolvency. However, it is important to know that this risk does exist, and that it can be difficult to recover from even a small dip into insolvency. Consider adding more targeted tests for these scenarios to better understand the behavior of the protocol, and designing relevant mechanics to make sure the platform operates properly. Also consider communicating the potential risks to the users if needed.

### 179. HoldeFi

**Finding**: Not using OpenZeppelin contracts

**Description**: OpenZeppelin maintains a library of standard, audited, community-reviewed, and battle-tested smart contracts. Instead of always importing these contracts, the Holdefi project reimplements them in some cases, while in other cases it just copies them. This increases the amount of code that the Holdefi team will have to maintain and misses all the improvements and bug fixes that the OpenZeppelin team is constantly implementing with the help of the community.

**Recommendation**: Consider importing the OpenZeppelin contracts instead of reimplementing or copying them. These contracts can be extended to add the extra functionalities required by Holdefi.

### 180. HoldeFi

**Finding**: Lack of `indexed` parameters in events

**Description**: Throughout the Holdefi’s codebase, none of the parameters in the events defined in the contracts are `indexed`.

**Recommendation**: Consider indexing event parameters to avoid hindering the task of off-chain services searching and filtering for specific events.

### 181. HoldeFi

**Finding**: Named return variables

**Description**: There is an inconsistent use of named return variables across the entire codebase.

**Recommendation**: Consider removing all named return variables, explicitly declaring them as local variables in the body of the function, and adding the necessary explicit return statements where appropriate. This should favor both explicitness and readability of the project.

### 182. HoldeFi

**Finding**: `block.timestamp` Unreliable:

**Description**: Code uses the `block.timestamp` as part of the calculations and time checks. Nevertheless, timestamps can be slightly altered by miners to favor them in contracts that have logics that depend strongly on them.

**Recommendation**: Consider taking into account this issue and warning the users that such a scenario could happen. If the alteration of timestamps cannot affect the protocol in any way, consider documenting the reasoning and writing tests enforcing that these guarantees will be preserved even if the code changes in the future.

## BarnBrige Smart Yield Bonds Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/barnbridge-smart-yield-bonds-audit/)

### 183. BarnBrige Smart Yield Bonds

**Finding**: Assignment in `require` statement

**Description**: In the `YieldOracle` contract, there is a `require` statement that makes an assignment. This deviates from the standard usage and intention of require statements and can easily lead to confusion.

**Recommendation**: Consider moving the assignment to its own line before the `require` statement and then using the `require` statement solely for condition checking.

### 184. BarnBrige Smart Yield Bonds

**Finding**: Commented code

**Description**: Throughout the codebase there are lines of code that have been commented out with `//`. This can lead to confusion and is detrimental to overall code readability.

**Recommendation**: Consider removing commented out lines of code that are no longer needed.
___
## Compound Governor Bravo Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-governor-bravo-audit/)

### 185. Compound Governor Bravo

**Finding**: Misleading `revert` messages

**Description**: Error messages are intended to notify users about failing conditions, and should provide enough information so that the appropriate corrections needed to interact with the system can be applied. Uninformative error messages greatly damage the overall user experience, thus lowering the system’s quality.

**Recommendation**: Consider not only fixing the specific issues mentioned, but also reviewing the entire codebase to make sure every error message is informative and user-friendly enough. Furthermore, for consistency, consider reusing error messages when extremely similar conditions are checked.
___
##  Fei Protocol Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/fei-protocol-audit/)

### 186.  Fei Protocol

**Finding**: Multiple outdated Solidity versions in use

**Description**: Outdated versions of Solidity are being used in all contracts. The compiler options in the `truffle-config` file specifies version `0.6.6`, which was released on April 6, 2020. Throughout the codebase there are also different versions of Solidity being used.

**Recommendation**: As Solidity is now under a fast release cycle, consider using a more recent version of the compiler, such as version `0.7.6`. In addition, to avoid unexpected behavior, consider specifying explicit Solidity versions in `pragma` statements.

### 187.  Fei Protocol

**Finding**: Test and production constants in the same codebase

**Description**: The `CoreOrchestrator` contract defines the `TEST_MODE` boolean variable which is used to define several constants in the system. This decreases legibility of production code, and makes the system’s integral values more `error-prone`.

**Recommendation**: Consider having different environments for production and testing, with different contracts.

### 188.  Fei Protocol

**Finding**: Unnecessarily small integer sizes

**Description**: In Solidity, using integers smaller than 256 bits tends to increase gas costs because the Ethereum Virtual Machine must perform additional operations to zero out the unused bits. This can be justified by savings in storage costs in some scenarios, however, that is not generally the case in this codebase.

**Recommendation**: Consider using integers of size 256 bits to improve gas efficiency and mitigate function reverts.

### 189.  Fei Protocol

**Finding**: Use of `uint` instead of `uint256`

**Description**: Across the codebase, there are hundreds of instances of `uint`, as opposed to `uint256`.

**Recommendation**: In favor of explicitness, consider replacing all instances of `uint` with `uint256`.
___
## Uma Phase 4 Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/uma-audit-phase-4/)

### 190. Uma Phase 4

**Finding**: Functions with unexpected side-effects

**Description**: Some functions have side-effects. For example, the `_getLatestFundingRate` function of the `FundingRateApplier` contract might also update the funding rate and send rewards. The `getPrice` function of the `OptimisticOracle` contract might also settle a price request. These side-effect actions are not clear in the name of the functions and are thus unexpected, which could lead to mistakes when the code is modified by new developers not experienced in all the implementation details of the project.

**Recommendation**: Consider splitting these functions in separate getters and setters. Alternatively, consider renaming the functions to describe all the actions that they perform.
___
## GEB Protocol Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/geb-protocol-audit/)

### 191. GEB Protocol

**Finding**: Unsafe casting

**Description**: In line 554 of the `TaxCollector` contract, the value of `coinBalance(receiver)` is an `uint`. This is cast to an `int` and then negated. However, since `uint` can store higher values than `int`, it is possible that casting from `uint` to `int` may create an overflow.

**Recommendation**: Consider verifying that the value of `coinBalance(receiver)` is within the acceptable range for negative `int` values before casting and negating. Consider using OpenZeppelin’s `SafeCast` contract, which provides functions for safely casting between types.

### 192. GEB Protocol

**Finding**: Unsafe division in `rdivide` and `wdivide` functions

**Description**: The function `rdivide` on line 227 and the function `wdivide` on line 230 of the `GlobalSettlement` contract, accept the divisor `y` as an input parameter. However, these functions do not check if the value of `y` is 0. If that is the case, the call will `revert` due to the division by zero error.

**Recommendation**: To prevent such unsafe calculations, consider adding a `require` statement in the functions to ensure `y > 0`, or consider using the `div` functions provided in OpenZeppelin’s `SafeMath` libraries.

### 193. GEB Protocol

**Finding**: Uncommented assembly block

**Description**: The `OracleRelayer` contract includes an assembly block in the `rpower()` function. The same assembly block is repeated in the `TaxCollector` and `CoinSavingsAccount` contracts. While this does not pose a security risk per se, it is at the same time a complicated and critical part of the system. Moreover, as this is a low-level language that is harder to parse by readers, consider including extensive documentation regarding the rationale behind its use, clearly explaining what every single assembly instruction does. This will make it easier for users to trust the code, for reviewers to verify it, and for developers to build on top of it or update it. Note that the use of assembly discards several important safety features of Solidity, which may render the code unsafer and more error-prone.

**Recommendation**: Consider implementing thorough tests to cover all potential use cases of these functions to ensure they behave as expected.

### 194. GEB Protocol

**Finding**: Unnecessary `require` statements

**Description**: There are several instances in the code base where the `require` statements or conditional checks are unnecessary. For instance: In the `OracleRelayer` contract, the `require` statement in the `modifyParameters` function at line 189 checks if the input parameter `data > 0`. This is unnecessary since the same condition is already checked in the `require` statement at line 187.

**Recommendation**: To simplify the code and prevent wastage of gas, consider removing the unnecessary checks.

### 195. GEB Protocol

**Finding**: Unnecessary `event` emission

**Description**: The `popDebtFromQueue` function of the `AccountingEngine` contract is emitting a useless event whenever someone tries to call it with a `debtBlockTimestamp` that has not been saved before.

**Recommendation**: To simplify the code and prevent wastage of gas, avoid emitting unnecessary events.

## Opyn Gamma Protocol Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/opyn-gamma-protocol-audit/)

### 196. Opyn Gamma Protocol

**Finding**: oToken can be created with a non-whitelisted collateral asset

**Description**: A product consists of a set of assets and an option type. Each product has to be whitelisted by the admin using the `whitelistProduct` function from the `Whitelist` contract.

**Recommendation**: Consider validating if the assets involved in a product have been already whitelisted before allowing the creation of oTokens.

### 197. Opyn Gamma Protocol

**Finding**: Mismatches between contracts and interfaces

**Description**: Interfaces define the exposed functionality of the implemented contracts. However, in several interfaces there are functions from the counterpart contracts that are not defined.

**Recommendation**: Consider applying the necessary changes in the mentioned interfaces and contracts so that definitions and implementations fully match.

### 198. Opyn Gamma Protocol

**Finding**: Actions not executed atomically might lead to inconsistent state

**Description**: The `setAssetPricer`, `setLockingPeriod`, and `setDisputePeriod` functions of the `Oracle` contract execute actions that are always expected to be performed atomically. Failing to do so can lead to inconsistent states in the system.

**Recommendation**: Consider implementing an additional function that calls the `setAssetPricer`, `setLockingPeriod`, and `setDisputePeriod` functions, so that these actions can be executed atomically in a single transaction.

### 199. Opyn Gamma Protocol

**Finding**: Chainlink `Pricer` is using a deprecated API

**Description**: The Chainlink `Pricer` is currently using multiple functions from a deprecated Chainlink API such as `latestAnswer()` in L61, `getTimestamp()` in L74. These functions might suddenly stop working if Chainlink stopped supporting deprecated APIs.

**Recommendation**: Consider refactoring these to use the latest Chainlink API.
___
## PoolTogether V3 Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/pooltogether-v3-audit/)

### 200. PoolTogether V3

**Finding**: Funds can be lost

**Description**: The `sweepTimelockBalances` function accepts a list of users with unlocked balances to distribute. However, if there are duplicate users in the list, their balances will be counted multiple times when calculating the total amount to withdraw from the yield service.

**Recommendation**: Consider checking for duplicate users when calculating the amount to withdraw.
___
## Set Protocol Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/set-protocol-audit/)

### 201. Set Protocol

**Finding**: Use `delete` to clear variables

**Description**: The `Controller` contract sets a variable to the zero address in order to clear it. Similarly, the `SetToken` clears the locker by assigning the zero address.

**Recommendation**: The `delete` key better conveys the intention and is also more idiomatic. Consider replacing assignments of zero with `delete` statements.
